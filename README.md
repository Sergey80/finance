Just some dictionary-like notes about finane in scala (mostly about trading), the definitions / objects and the relationship 

Followed the idea to make the notes in a programming language (here scala) while familiarizing myself with a subject (finance/trading).
That for sure makes things/notes more structural and all this maybe a good start/material for further steps.

Almost all material I got from http://www.investopedia.com (/dictionary/) (there is no any 'private' data) other than my effort to tie it rogether.
