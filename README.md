Just some dictionary-like notes about finance in scala (mostly about trading), the definitions / objects and the relationship 

Followed the idea to make the notes in a programming language (here scala) while familiarizing myself with a subject (finance/trading).
That for sure makes things/notes more structural and all this maybe a good start/material for further steps.

Almost all material I got from http://www.investopedia.com (/dictionary/) (there is no any 'private' data) other than my effort to tie it rogether.

* Principal Trading
 In a principal transaction, an adviser, acting for its own account, buys a security from, or sells a security to, the account of a client. A principal transaction also includes a situation where an affiliate or controlling person of an investment adviser engages in a trade with an advisory client.

A principal trade occurs when a brokerage house buys securities on the secondary market with the express strategy to hold long enough for a price appreciation. At that point the broker sells retails to the end use and gains appreciation plus commission.
