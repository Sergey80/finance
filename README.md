Just some dictionary-like notes about finane in scala (mostly about trading), the definitions / objects and the relationship 

Followed the idea to make the notes in a programming language (here scala) while familiarizing myself with a subject (finance/trading).
That's for sure make things/notes more structural and maybe good start/material for further steps.

almost all material I got from http://www.investopedia.com (/dictionary/) (there is no any 'private' data).
